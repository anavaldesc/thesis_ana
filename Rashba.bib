	abstract = {We describe a Fourier transform spectroscopy technique for directly measuring band structures, and apply it to a spin-1 spin–orbit coupled Bose–Einstein condensate. In our technique, we suddenly change the Hamiltonian of the system by adding a spin–orbit coupling interaction and measure populations in different spin states during the subsequent unitary evolution. We then reconstruct the spin and momentum resolved spectrum from the peak frequencies of the Fourier transformed populations. In addition, by periodically modulating the Hamiltonian, we tune the spin–orbit coupling strength and use our spectroscopy technique to probe the resulting dispersion relation. The frequency resolution of our method is limited only by the coherent evolution timescale of the Hamiltonian and can otherwise be applied to any system, for example, to measure the band structure of atoms in optical lattice potentials.},

An electron traveling along a closed path in the momentum space of the graphene crystal lattice may not end up exactly the way it started. If its path happens to include one of the special points in momentum space, it will acquire a phase shift. Physicists can detect the signatures of this process by studying the transport properties of graphene. Duca et al. used interferometry to directly measure this so-called Berry flux in a hexagonal optical lattice, where intersecting laser beams simulate the environment that electrons experience in graphene (see the Perspective by Lamacraft). The high-precision technique may be useful in characterizing other topological structures.
Science, this issue p. 288; see also p. 232
The geometric structure of a single-particle energy band in a solid is fundamental for a wide range of many-body phenomena and is uniquely characterized by the distribution of Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. We realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space, in analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures magnetic flux in real space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal optical lattice loaded with bosonic atoms. By detecting the singular π Berry flux localized at each Dirac point, we establish the high momentum resolution of this interferometric technique. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures.
Interferometric techniques are used to measure the Berry flux in the momentum space of a hexagonal optical lattice. [Also see Perspective by Lamacraft]

A striking manifestation of this transverse transport was then revealed in the quantum Hall effect2 where the plateaux depicted by the Hall conductivity were attributed to a topological invariant characterizing the Bloch bands: the Chern number3. Until now, topological transport associated with non-zero Chern numbers has only been observed in electronic systems2,4,5. Here we use the transverse deflection of an atomic cloud in response to an optical gradient to measure the Chern number of artificially generated Hofstadter bands6. These topological bands are very flat and thus constitute good candidates for the realization of fractional Chern insulators7. Combining these deflection measurements with the determination of the band populations, we obtain an experimental value for the Chern number of the lowest band νexp = 0.99(5). This first Chern-number measurement in a non-electronic system is facilitated by an all-optical artificial gauge field scheme, generating uniform flux in optical superlattices.},

	abstract = {Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide promising platforms to explore novel quantum physics, in particular the exotic topological phases, beyond natural conditions of solids. The past several years have witnessed important progresses in both theory and experiment in the study of SO coupling and novel quantum states for ultracold atoms. Here we review the physics of the SO coupled quantum gases, focusing on the latest theoretical and experimental progresses of realizing SO couplings beyond one-dimension (1D), and the further investigation of novel topological quantum phases in such systems, including the topological insulating phases and topological superfluids. A pedagogical introduction to the SO coupling for ultracold atoms and topological quantum phases is presented. We show that the so-called optical Raman lattice schemes, which combine the creation of the conventional optical lattice and Raman lattice with topological stability, can provide minimal methods with high experimental feasibility to realize 1D to 3D SO couplings. The optical Raman lattices exhibit novel intrinsic symmetries, which enable the natural realization of topological phases belonging to different symmetry classes, with the topology being detectable through minimal measurement strategies. We introduce how the non-Abelian Majorana modes emerge in the SO coupled superfluid phases which can be topologically nontrivial or trivial, for which a few fundamental theorems are presented and discussed. The experimental schemes for achieving non-Abelian superfluid phases are given. Finally, we point out the future important issues in this rapidly growing research field.},

It provided the basis for the proposal of the spin transistor by Datta and Das in 1990, which has largely inspired the broad and dynamic field of spintronics. More recent developments include new materials for the Rashba effect such as metal surfaces, interfaces and bulk materials. It has also given rise to new phenomena such as spin currents and the spin Hall effect, including its quantized version, which has led to the very active field of topological insulators. The Rashba effect plays a crucial role in yet more exotic fields of physics such as the search for Majorana fermions at semiconductor-superconductor interfaces and the interaction of ultracold atomic Bose and Fermi gases. Advances in our understanding of Rashba-type spin-orbit couplings, both qualitatively and quantitatively, can be obtained in many different ways. This focus issue brings together the wide range of research activities on Rashba physics to further promote the development of our physical pictures and concepts in this field.

The corresponding single-particle spectrum is generally anisotropic and contains two degenerate minima at finite momenta. At low temperatures, the many-body system condenses into these minima generating a type of entangled Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that in the presence of weak density-density interactions the many-body ground state is characterized by a twofold degeneracy. The corresponding many-body wave function describes a condensate of “left-” and “right-moving” bosons. By fine-tuning the parameters of the laser field, one can obtain a bosonic version of the spin-orbit coupled Rashba model. In this symmetric case, the degeneracy of the ground state is very large, which may lead to phases with nontrivial topological properties. We argue that the predicted type of Bose-Einstein condensates can be observed experimentally via time-of-flight imaging, which will show characteristic multipeak structures in momentum distribution.},

Topological properties lie at the heart of many fascinating phenomena in solid-state systems such as quantum Hall systems or Chern insulators. The topology of the bands can be captured by the distribution of Berry curvature, which describes the geometry of the eigenstates across the Brillouin zone. Using fermionic ultracold atoms in a hexagonal optical lattice, we engineered the Berry curvature of the Bloch bands using resonant driving and show a full momentum-resolved measurement of the ensuing Berry curvature.

The unequivocal characterization of such topological physics requires a simple scheme for measuring the Berry phase originating from the SOC. Here we propose a scheme to realize momentum space Aharonov-Bohm interferometry in a Rashba spin-orbit–coupled Bose-Einstein condensate through a sudden change of the in-plane Zeeman field. We find that the π Berry phase for the Dirac point of the Rashba SOC is directly revealed by a robust dark interference fringe in the momentum space. An external perpendicular Zeeman field opens a band gap at the Dirac point, which reduces the Berry phase along the Rashba ring, leading to lower brightness of the interference fringe. We develop a variational model with semiclassical equations of motion of essential dynamical quantities for describing the interference process, yielding real and momentum space trajectories and geometric phases agreeing with the real-time simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Our study may pave the way for the experimental detection of Berry phases in ultracold atomic systems and further exploration of momentum space interference dynamics.},

Taking the low-Berry-curvature limit results in equations that can be directly compared to previous results for the motion of wave packets.

These schemes use N cyclically coupled ground or metastable internal states. We focus on two situations: a three-level case and a four-level case, where the latter adds a controllable Dresselhaus contribution. We describe an implementation of the four-level scheme for 87Rb and analyze its sensitivity to typical laboratory noise sources.

At these detunings, the Raman matrix elements that link m F magnetic sublevel quantum numbers separated by two are also suppressed. These matrix elements are necessary to produce the Rashba Hamiltonian within a single total angular momentum f manifold.

Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect.

This field was inspired by the discovery of topological insulators, in which interfacial electrons transport without dissipation, even in the presence of impurities. Similarly, the use of carefully designed wavevector-space topologies allows the creation of interfaces that support new states of light with useful and interesting properties. In particular, this suggests unidirectional waveguides that allow light to flow around large imperfections without back-reflection. This Review explains the underlying principles and highlights how topological effects can be realized in photonic crystals, coupled resonators, metamaterials and quasicrystals.},

	abstract = {Electronic topological insulators are one of the breakthroughs of 21st century condensed matter physics. So far, the search for a light counterpart of an electronic time-reversal invariant topological insulator has remained elusive. This is due to the fundamentally different natures of light and matter and the different spins of photons and electrons. Here, it is shown that the theory of electronic topological insulators has a genuine analog in the context of light wave propagation in time-reversal invariant continuous materials. We introduce a gauge invariant Z2 index that depends on the global properties of the photonic band structure and is robust to any continuous weak variation of the material parameters that preserves the time-reversal invariance. A nontrivial Z2 index has two possible causes: (i) the lack of smoothness of the pseudo-Hamiltonian in the k→∞ limit and (ii) the entanglement between positive and negative frequency eigenmode branches. In particular, it is proven that electric-type plasmas and magnetic-type plasmas are topologically inequivalent for a fixed wave polarization. We propose a bulk-edge correspondence that links the number of edge modes with the topological invariants of two continuous bulk materials and present detailed numerical examples that illustrate the application of the theory.},

We reveal the pump’s genuine quantum nature by showing that, in contrast to ground-state particles, a counterintuitive reversed deflection occurs for particles in the first excited band. Furthermore, we directly demonstrate that the system undergoes a controlled topological transition in higher bands when tuning the superlattice parameters.

	abstract = {Visualizing edge states in atomic systems
Visualizing edge states in atomic systems Simulating the solid state using ultracold atoms is an appealing research approach. In solids, however, the charged electrons are susceptible to an external magnetic field, which curves their trajectories and makes them skip along the edge of the sample. To observe this phenomenon with cold atoms requires an artificial magnetic field to have a similar effect on the neutral atoms (see the Perspective by Celi and Tarruell). Stuhl et al. obtained skipping orbits with bosonic atoms using a lattice that consisted of an array of atoms in one direction and three internal atomic spin states in the other. In a complementary experiment, Mancini et al. observed similar physics with fermionic atoms.
Science, this issue pp. 1514 and 1510; see also p. 1450
Chiral edge states are a hallmark of quantum Hall physics. In electronic systems, they appear as a macroscopic consequence of the cyclotron orbits induced by a magnetic field, which are naturally truncated at the physical boundary of the sample. Here we report on the experimental realization of chiral edge states in a ribbon geometry with an ultracold gas of neutral fermions subjected to an artificial gauge field. By imaging individual sites along a synthetic dimension, encoded in the nuclear spin of the atoms, we detect the existence of the edge states and observe the edge-cyclotron orbits induced during quench dynamics. The realization of fermionic chiral edge states opens the door for edge state interferometry and the study of non-Abelian anyons in atomic systems.
Analogs of quantum-Hall-effect edge states are observed with fermionic ytterbium-173 atoms in a synthetic lattice. [Also see Perspective by Celi and Tarruell]

	abstract = {The Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice is a paradigmatic example of a Hamiltonian featuring topologically distinct phases of matter1. It describes a mechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic property of a band structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic field2. Although physical implementation has been considered unlikely, the Haldane model has provided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research exploring topological insulators and superconductors2,3,4,5,6. Here we report the experimental realization of the Haldane model and the characterization of its topological band structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The Haldane model is based on breaking both time-reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry. To break time-reversal symmetry, we introduce complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms, which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position7. To break inversion symmetry, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites8. Breaking either of these symmetries opens a gap in the band structure, which we probe using momentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting Berry curvatures, which characterize the topology of the lowest band, by applying a constant force to the atoms and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between the two broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically distinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we map out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively compare it to calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our approach, which allows us to tune the topological properties dynamically, is suitable even for interacting fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a direct extension to realize spin-dependent topological Hamiltonians.},

Following the quench, the distribution of excitations in the final conventional phase carries signatures of the TPT. We apply this strategy to study the TPT into a Majorana-carrying topological phase predicted in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Fermi gases with attractive interactions. The resulting spin-resolved momentum distribution, computed by self-consistently solving the time-dependent Bogoliubov–de Gennes equations, exhibits Kibble-Zurek scaling and Stückelberg oscillations characteristic of the TPT.

However, especially driven systems of interacting bosonic particles often suffer from strong heating. We have systematically studied heating in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a driven one-dimensional optical lattice. We find interaction dependent heating rates that depend on both the scattering length and the driving strength and identify the underlying resonant intra- and interband scattering processes. By comparing the experimental data and theory, we find that, for driving frequencies well above the trap depth, the heating rate is dramatically reduced by the fact that resonantly scattered atoms leave the trap before dissipating their energy into the system. This mechanism of Floquet evaporative cooling offers a powerful strategy to minimize heating in Floquet engineered quantum gases.},

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect1,2 and topological insulators3,4,5; it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices6. Quantum many-body systems of ultracold atoms can be precisely controlled experimentally, and would therefore seem to provide an ideal platform on which to study SO coupling. Although an atom’s intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba7 and Dresselhaus8 strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose–Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers9. Such coupling has not been realized previously for ultracold atomic gases, or indeed any bosonic system. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase-separated state (above a critical laser intensity). We develop a many-body theory that provides quantitative agreement with the observed location of the transition. The engineered SO coupling—equally applicable for bosons and fermions—sets the stage for the realization of topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems.},

	abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z2 topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (px±ipy)-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to “weak pairing”) and topologically trivial (analogous to “strong pairing”) 3D phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior. When an electromagnetic U(1) gauge field and fluctuations of the gap functions are included in the dynamics, the superconducting phases with nonvanishing winding number possess nontrivial topological ground-state degeneracies.},

	abstract = {We study the relaxation of a spin density injected into a two-dimensional electron system with generic spin-orbit interactions. Our model includes the Rashba as well as linear and cubic Dresselhaus terms. We explicitly derive a general spin-charge coupled diffusion equation. Spin diffusion is characterized by just two independent dimensionless parameters, γR and γD, which control the interplay between different spin-orbit couplings. The real-time representation of the diffuson matrix (Green’s function of the diffusion equation) is evaluated analytically. The diffuson describes space-time dynamics of the injected spin distribution. We explicitly study two regimes: The first regime corresponds to negligible spin-charge coupling and is characterized by standard charge diffusion decoupled from the spin dynamics. It is shown that there exist several qualitatively different dynamic behaviors of the spin density, which correspond to various domains in the (γR,γD) parameter space. We discuss in detail a few interesting phenomena such as an enhancement of the spin-relaxation times, real-space oscillatory dynamics, and anisotropic transport. In the second regime, we include the effects of spin-charge coupling. It is shown that the spin-charge coupling leads to an enhancement of the effective charge diffusion coefficient. We also find that in the case of strong spin-charge coupling, the relaxation rates formally become complex and the spin-charge dynamics is characterized by real-time oscillations.

Exploiting topological properties of a system allows certain properties to be protected against the disorder and scattering caused by defects. Barik et al. demonstrate a strong light-matter interaction in a topological photonic structure (see the Perspective by Amo). They created topological edge states at the interface between two photonic, topologically distinct regions and coupled them to a single quantum emitter. The chiral nature of single-photon emission was used to inject single photons of opposite polarization into counterpropagating topological edge states. Such a topological quantum optics interface may provide a powerful platform for developing robust integrated quantum optical circuits.
Science, this issue p. 666; see also p. 638
The application of topology in optics has led to a new paradigm in developing photonic devices with robust properties against disorder. Although considerable progress on topological phenomena has been achieved in the classical domain, the realization of strong light-matter coupling in the quantum domain remains unexplored. We demonstrate a strong interface between single quantum emitters and topological photonic states. Our approach creates robust counterpropagating edge states at the boundary of two distinct topological photonic crystals. We demonstrate the chiral emission of a quantum emitter into these modes and establish their robustness against sharp bends. This approach may enable the development of quantum optics devices with built-in protection, with potential applications in quantum simulation and sensing.
Light-matter coupling is achieved between topologically protected photonic edge states and a quantum emitter.

Thus, gain concentrated along the edge of the insulator can counteract intrinsic losses in such a selective way that the topologically protected edge states become amplified, while bulk modes remain damped.

Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

Topological effects that arise from material boundaries are well known in solid-state physics and form the basis for topological insulators. Delplace et al. describe atmospheric and ocean waves that appear to have a similar topological origin (see the Perspective by Biello and Dimofte). The waves exist because of the symmetry-breaking nature of Earth's rotation, which allows certain fixed topological constraints on the system. These findings may be useful for understanding a wide variety of geophysical and astrophysical flows.
Science, this issue p. 1075; see also p. 990
Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk Poincaré wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators and that topology plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system.
Equatorially trapped Kelvin and Yanai waves have a topological origin.

The topological properties of the sound waves can be wholly tuned in situ by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of a driving laser that controls the optomechanical interaction between light and sound. The resulting chiral, topologically protected phonon transport can be probed completely optically. Moreover, we identify a regime of strong mixing between photon and phonon excitations, which gives rise to a large set of different topological phases and offers an example of a Chern insulator produced from the interaction between two physically distinct particle species, photons and phonons.},

These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in topological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising property: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without backscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we develop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a scheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure containing circulating fluids. The phenomenon of disorder-free one-way sound propagation, which does not occur in ordinary acoustic devices, may have novel applications for acoustic isolators, modulators, and transducers.},

	abstract = {The Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) axial anomaly is derived from the physical point of view as the production of Weyl particles and it is used to show the absence of the net production of particles for lattice regularized chirally invariant theories with locality. An analogy or a simulation is pointed out between the Weyl fermion theory and gapless semiconductors where two energy bands have pointlike degeneracies. For such materials, in the presence of parallel electric and strong magnetic fields, there exists an effect similar to the ABJ anomaly that is the movement of the electrons in the energy-momentum space from the neighborhood of one degeneracy point to another one. The longitudinal magneto-conduction becomes extremely strong.},

Such schemes are particularly promising for generating nontrivial energy bands and gauge structures in quantum-matter systems. Here, we develop a general formalism that captures the essential features ruling the dynamics: the effective Hamiltonian, but also the effects related to the initial phase of the modulation and the micromotion. This framework allows for the identification of driving schemes, based on general N-step modulations, which lead to configurations relevant for quantum simulation. In particular, we explore methods to generate synthetic spin-orbit couplings and magnetic fields in cold-atom setups.},

	abstract = {The Enrico Fermi summer school on Quantum Matter at Ultralow Temperatures held on 7-15 July 2014 at Varenna, Italy, featured important frontiers in the field of ultracold atoms. For the last 25 years, this field has undergone dramatic developments, which were chronicled by several Varenna summer schools, in 1991 on Laser Manipulation of Atoms, in 1998 on Bose-Einstein Condensation in Atomic Gases, and in 2006 on Ultra-cold Fermi Gases. The theme of the 2014 school demonstrates that the field has now branched out into many different directions, where the tools and precision of atomic physics are used to realise new quantum systems, or in other words, to quantum-engineer interesting Hamiltonians. The topics of the school identify major new directions: Quantum gases with long range interactions, either due to strong magnetic dipole forces, due to Rydberg excitations, or, for polar molecules, due to electric dipole interactions; quantum gases in lower dimensions; quantum gases with disorder; atoms in optical lattices, now with single-site optical resolution; systems with non-trivial topological properties, e.g. with spin-orbit coupling or in artificial gauge fields; quantum impurity problems (Bose and Fermi polarons); quantum magnetism. Fermi gases with strong interactions, spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and coupled multi-component Bose gases or Bose-Fermi mixtures continue to be active areas. The current status of several of these areas is systematically summarized in this volume.},

Whereas, in general, SOC is fixed in a system, laser–atom interaction provides a means to create and control synthetic SOC in ultracold atoms1. Despite significant experimental progress in this area2,3,4,5,6,7,8, two-dimensional (2D) synthetic SOC, which is crucial for exploring two- and three-dimensional topological phases, is lacking. Here, we report the experimental realization of 2D SOC in ultracold 40K Fermi gases using three lasers, each of which dresses one atomic hyperfine spin state. Through spin-injection radiofrequency (rf) spectroscopy4, we probe the spin-resolved energy dispersions of the dressed atoms, and observe a highly controllable Dirac point created by the 2D SOC. These results constitute a step towards the realization of new topological states of matter.},

Studying topological matter in cold-atom systems may bring fresh insights, thanks to the intrinsic purity and controllability of this experimental setting. However, the necessary spin-orbit coupling can be tricky to engineer. Wu et al. conceived and experimentally demonstrated a simple scheme that involves only a single laser source and can be continuously tuned between one- and two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling (see the Perspective by Aidelsburger). Although this experiment used bosonic atoms, it is expected that the setup would also work for fermions.
Science, this issue p. 83; see also p. 35
Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide a platform to explore quantum physics beyond natural conditions of solids. Here we propose and experimentally realize two-dimensional (2D) SO coupling and topological bands for a rubidium-87 degenerate gas through an optical Raman lattice, without phase-locking or fine-tuning of optical potentials. A controllable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO effects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the atomic cloud distribution and spin texture in momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including topological superfluids.
Rubidium atoms are used to demonstrate a spin-orbit coupling scheme that is tunable between the 1- and 2D limits. [Also see Perspective by Aidelsburger]

	abstract = {We show that interacting bosons in a periodically driven two dimensional (2D) optical lattice may effectively exhibit fermionic statistics. The phenomenon is similar to the celebrated Tonks-Girardeau regime in 1D. The Floquet band of a driven lattice develops the moat shape, i.e., a minimum along a closed contour in the Brillouin zone. Such degeneracy of the kinetic energy favors fermionic quasiparticles. The statistical transmutation is achieved by the Chern-Simons flux attachment similar to the fractional quantum Hall case. We show that the velocity distribution of the released bosons is a sensitive probe of the fermionic nature of their stationary Floquet state.},
