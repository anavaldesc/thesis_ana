Generic notes:

-Where do I write about gradient cancellation? Seems like an important thing to keep.
-Maybe for stuff above and other things like ptai and measuring magnification dedicate one chapter?
-The subtle difference between dephasing and decoherence. 
-Thesis chapter: is it ok if I loose some of the punchline in favor of pedagogy?

Stuff for Topology Chapter (Ch 7?):

-Where does the theory part of topology go?! Intro Chapter or Rashba Chapter?

-Light-induced gauge fields for ultracold atoms: has some stuff on the interpretation of the Chern number as the number of times a vector covers the Bloch sphere. 
-https://www.math.purdue.edu/~ebkaufma/RMP.pdf good for understanding fiber bundles in the context of Chern stuff
-http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sunkai/teaching/Fall_2012/chapter3_part3.pdf useful to understand Dirac strings and generic topology stuff. 
-http://cem.osu.edu/files/2017/03/Kane-Marcel-Franz-book.pdf this one is gold (good explanations of basic concepts of topology)
-https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/8/083022/pdf explains winding number mapping torus into bloch spbere
-http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/pubs/preskill-1984-monopoles.pdf intro to Dirac strings

Stuff for Rashba:

Need to understand and write about:
-Collisional decays from F=2
-Why matrix elements are no good in F=1 without clock states
-Dark state interpretation of things. This one might be good:
https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.010404
-Why do we never bother about tensor light shifts?! Because it is smaaallll
-Why does hyperfine splitting enable state dependent `vector' light shift? 
-Should read/talk about spin-relaxation collisions. Don't understand. 
-If detuning is small the +-1 angular momentum transfer condition is relaxed but spontaneous emission increases. 

Atomic physics stuff:
-Dan's chapter titled "Spin-orbit coupling ultracold atoms, the basics" has an explanation of selection rules and Raman
-Helpful stuff on Wigner-Eckart and matrix elements: https://www.physics.umd.edu/grt/taj/623e/tops2017.pdf 

-Raman pulses at different wavelengths: data taken on 10/10/2017
