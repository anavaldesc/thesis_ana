\section{Thesis overview}


This is the story I'm telling: Cold atoms are a great platform. They are very controllable and 

\begin{itemize}
	\item A toolbox for manipulation and engineering of the system
	\item Characterizing the system, here would go absorption imaging (TOF and SG included), maybe PTAI. Quantum coherent evolution to learn about a system: Rabi spectroscopy, Ramsey spectroscopy
	\item Fourier transform spectroscopy.
	\item Combining the toolbox and characterization techniques 
	%\subitem Is this a thing?	
\end{itemize}
