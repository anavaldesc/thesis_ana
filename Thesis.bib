	abstract = {A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian Ĥ(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp\{iγ(C)\} in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

The use of electromagnetic forces to influence the motion of neutral atoms has been a subject of interest for some years, and several review articles and books on the subject are listed in Appendix B. The force caused by radiation, particularly by light at or near the resonance frequencies of atomic transitions, originates from the momentum associated with light. In addition to energy E = ℏω, each photon carries momentum ℏk and angular momentum ℏ. When an atom absorbs light, it stores the energy by going into an excited state; it stores the momentum by recoiling from the light source with a momentum ℏk; and it stores the angular momentum in the form of internal motion of its electrons. The converse applies for emission, whether it is stimulated or spontaneous. It is the velocity change of the atoms, vr = ℏk/M ≃ few cm/s, that is of special interest here, and although it is very small compared with thermal velocity, multiple absorptions can be used to produce a large total velocity change. Proper control of this velocity change constitutes a radiative force that can be used to decelerate and/or to cool free atoms.},

First we discuss those methods where the spectral resolution is limited by the Doppler width of the molecular absorption lines. This limit can in fact be reached if the laser linewidth is small compared with the Doppler width. In several examples, such as optical pumping or laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, multimode lasers may be employed, although in most cases single-mode lasers are superior. In general, however, these lasers may not necessarily be frequency stabilized as long as the frequency jitter is small compared with the absorption linewidth. We compare several detection techniques of molecular absorption spectroscopy with regard to their sensitivity and their feasibility in the different spectral regions. Some examples illustrate the methods to give the reader a feeling of what has been achieved. After the discussion of Doppler-limited spectroscopy, Chaps. 2–5 give an extensive treatment of various techniques which allow sub-Doppler spectroscopy.},

The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

	abstract = {Topology, with its abstract mathematical constructs, often manifests itself in physics and has a pivotal role in our understanding of natural phenomena. Notably, the discovery of topological phases in condensed-matter systems has changed the modern conception of phases of matter1,2,3,4,5. The global nature of topological ordering, however, makes direct experimental probing an outstanding challenge. Present experimental tools are mainly indirect and, as a result, are inadequate for studying the topology of physical systems at a fundamental level. Here we employ the exquisite control afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits to investigate topological properties of various quantum systems. The essence of our approach is to infer geometric curvature by measuring the deflection of quantum trajectories in the curved space of the Hamiltonian6. Topological properties are then revealed by integrating the curvature over closed surfaces, a quantum analogue of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. We benchmark our technique by investigating basic topological concepts of the historically important Haldane model7 after mapping the momentum space of this condensed-matter model to the parameter space of a single-qubit Hamiltonian. In addition to constructing the topological phase diagram, we are able to visualize the microscopic spin texture of the associated states and their evolution across a topological phase transition. Going beyond non-interacting systems, we demonstrate the power of our method by studying topology in an interacting quantum system. This required a new qubit architecture8,9 that allows for simultaneous control over every term in a two-qubit Hamiltonian. By exploring the parameter space of this Hamiltonian, we discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological phase. Our work establishes a powerful, generalizable experimental platform to study topological phenomena in quantum systems.},

Topological properties of physical systems are reflected in so-called Chern numbers: A nonzero Chern number typically means that a system is topologically nontrivial. Sugawa et al. engineered a cold atom system with a nonzero second Chern number, in contrast to condensed matter physics, where only the first Chern number is usually invoked. The exotic topology relates to the emergence of a type of magnetic monopole called the Yang monopole (known from theoretical high-energy physics) in a five-dimensional space of internal degrees of freedom in a rubidium Bose-Einstein condensate. The results illustrate the potential of cold atoms physics to simulate high-energy phenomena.

	abstract = {The steady progress of physics requires for its theoretical formulation a mathematics that gets continually more advanced. This is only natural and to be expected. What, however, was not expected by the scientific workers of the last century was the particular form that the line of advancement of the mathematics would take, namely, it was expected that the mathematics would get more and more complicated, but would rest on a permanent basis of axioms and definitions, while actually the modern physical developments have required a mathematics that continually shifts its foundations and gets more abstract. Non-euclidean geometry and non-commutative algebra, which were at one time considered to be purely fictions of the mind and pastimes for logical thinkers, have now been found to be very necessary for the description of general facts of the physical world. It seems likely that this process of increasing abstraction will continue in the future and that advance in physics is to be associated with a continual modification and generalisation of the axioms at the base of the mathematics rather than with a logical development of any one mathematical scheme on a fixed foundation. There are at present fundamental problems in theoretical physics awaiting solution, e.g., the relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics and the nature of atomic nuclei (to be followed by more difficult ones such as the problem of life), the solution of which problems will presumably require a more drastic revision of our fundamental concepts than any that have gone before. Quite likely these changes will be so great that it will be beyond the power of human intelligence to get the necessary new ideas by direct attempts to formulate the experimental data in mathematical terms. The theoretical worker in the future will therefore have to proceed in a more indirect way. The most powerful method of advance that can be suggested at present is to employ all the resources of pure mathematics in attempts to perfect and generalise the mathematical formalism that forms the existing basis of theoretical physics, and after each success in this direction, to try to interpret the new mathematical features in terms of physical entities (by a process like Eddington’s Principle of Identification).},

	abstract = {Gauge fields are central in our modern understanding of physics at all scales. At the highest energy scales known, the microscopic universe is governed by particles interacting with each other through the exchange of gauge bosons. At the largest length scales, our Universe is ruled by gravity, whose gauge structure suggests the existence of a particle—the graviton—that mediates the gravitational force. At the mesoscopic scale, solid-state systems are subjected to gauge fields of different nature: materials can be immersed in external electromagnetic fields, but they can also feature emerging gauge fields in their low-energy description. In this review, we focus on another kind of gauge field: those engineered in systems of ultracold neutral atoms. In these setups, atoms are suitably coupled to laser fields that generate effective gauge potentials in their description. Neutral atoms ‘feeling’ laser-induced gauge potentials can potentially mimic the behavior of an electron gas subjected to a magnetic field, but also, the interaction of elementary particles with non-Abelian gauge fields. Here, we review different realized and proposed techniques for creating gauge potentials—both Abelian and non-Abelian—in atomic systems and discuss their implication in the context of quantum simulation. While most of these setups concern the realization of background and classical gauge potentials, we conclude with more exotic proposals where these synthetic fields might be made dynamical, in view of simulating interacting gauge theories with cold atoms.},

The emulation time is normally finite, limited by the depletion of the reservoirs. We show that it is possible to emulate the desired behaviour of the -symmetric Hamiltonian without depleting the reservoir levels, by including an additional coupling between them. This extends the emulation time indefinitely, when in the unbroken symmetry phase of the non-unitary dynamics.

	abstract = {An effective single-band Hamiltonian representing a crystal electron in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding form of a Bloch band by replacing ℏ→k by the operator →p−e→Ac. The resultant Schrödinger equation becomes a finite-difference equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum. The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of "rational" fields is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an "irrational" field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features, it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies. It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new type of magnetic "superlattice" is introduced, constructed so that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites. Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model, whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions experimentally is sketched.},

In this work we also take into account quantitatively the effect of some electronic configuration interaction.

	abstract = {Quantum control and measurement are two sides of the same coin. To affect a dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe. By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state. This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time. Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose–Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.},

While the adiabatic-elimination approximation is reliable when the detuning of the intermediate state is quite large, it cannot be trusted in other situations, and it does not allow one to estimate the population in the eliminated state. We introduce an alternative method that keeps all states in the description, without increasing the complexity by much. An integro-differential equation of Lippmann–Schwinger type generates a hierarchy of approximations, but very accurate results are already obtained in the lowest order.},

This is numerically averaged over the molecular velocity distribution and provides the theoretical shape of the resonance curves. It is found that resonances with such a technique have a theoretical half-width only 0.6 as great as those by conventional molecular beam resonance methods. In addition to producing sharper resonance minima, the new method has its resonances much less broadened by inhomogeneities of the fixed field, it makes possible resonance experiments in regions into which an oscillating field cannot be introduced, and it is more convenient and effective with short wave-length radiation.},

The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena.

This phenomenon, first predicted by Einstein in 1925 has been realized experimentally in 1995 in a remarkable series of experiments whose importance has been recognized by the award of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics. The condensate is actually a new state of matter, where quantum-mechanical wave functions of atoms behave as coherent matter waves in the same way as coherent light waves in the case of a laser. The authors provide a theoretical presentation of the main concepts underlying the physics of dilute atomic gases in conditions of extremely low temperatures where quantum effects play a crucial role. The main effort is devoted to discussion of the relevant theoretical aspects exhibited by these systms, such as the concept of order parameter, long range order, superfluidity and coherence. The mathematical formalism is presented in a form convenient for practical use. The book develops the theory of Bose gases starting from the pioneering Bogoliubov approach and gives special emphasis to the new physical features exhibited by non-uniform gases which are produced in the recent experiments with magnetic and optical traps. These features include the determination of the equilibrium profiles, the collective oscillations, the mechanism of the expansion of the gas after releasing the trap, the interference patterns obtained by overlapping two condensates, the rotational properties revealing the effects of superfluidity the Josephson-like phenomena associated with the coherence of the phase, the beyond mean field phenomena exhibited by quantum gases in conditions of reduced dimensionality. The book also discusses the alaogies and differences with the physics of "classical" superfluids like liquid helium and introduces some of the major features of trapped Fermi gases at low temperature, pointing out the consequences of superfluidity.},

The value of a¯, the average scattering length, also determines the slope of the s-wave phase shifts beyond the near-threshold region. The formula is applicable to the collisions of atoms cooled down in traps, where the scattering length determines the character of the atom-atom interaction. Our calculation shows that repulsion between atoms (a{\textgreater}0) is more likely than attraction with a ‘‘probability’’ of 75\%. For the Cs-Cs scattering in the 3Σu state, a¯=95.5aB has been obtained, where aB is the Bohr radius. The comparison of the calculated cross-section energy dependence with the experimental data gives evidence for a positive value for the Cs-Cs scattering length, which makes cesium Bose gas stable.},

When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form2, provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting value3,4. The stability limit is determined by a balance between the self-attractive forces and a repulsion that arises from position–momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to collapse5,6,7,8. Growth of the condensate is therefore punctuated by intermittent collapses9,10 that are triggered by either macroscopic quantum tunnelling or thermal fluctuation. Previous observations of growth and collapse dynamics have been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we report direct observations of the growth and subsequent collapse of a 7Li condensate with attractive interactions, using phase-contrast imaging. The success of the measurement lies in our ability to reduce the stochasticity in the dynamics by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state.},

Analysis of the Rabi-type oscillations between two spin states of an atom pair allows a direct determination of the coupling parameters in the interaction Hamiltonian. We deduce differences in scattering lengths from our data that can directly be compared to theoretical predictions in order to test interatomic potentials. Our measurements agree with the predictions within 20\%. The knowledge of these coupling parameters allows one to determine the nature of the magnetic ground state. Our data imply a ferromagnetic ground state for 87Rb in the f = 1 manifold, in agreement with earlier experiments performed without the optical lattice. For 87Rb in the f = 2 manifold, the data point towards an antiferromagnetic ground state; however our error bars do not exclude a possible cyclic phase.},

In our case, these two spin components have a propensity to phase separate, i.e., they are immiscible. Remarkably, these spin degrees of freedom can equivalently be described as a single-component attractive BEC. A spatially uniform mixture of these spins is dynamically unstable, rapidly amplifying any quantum or pre-existing classical spin fluctuations. This coherent growth process drives the formation of numerous spin-polarized domains, which are far from the system's ground state. At much longer times these domains grow in size, coarsening, as the system approaches equilibrium. The experimentally observed time evolution is consistent with our fully three-dimensional stochastic-projected Gross–Pitaevskii calculation.},

Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose–Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

	abstract = {Topological order can be found in a wide range of physical systems, from crystalline solids, photonic meta-materials and even atmospheric waves to optomechanic, acoustic and atomic systems. Topological systems are a robust foundation for creating quantized channels for transporting electrical current, light, and atmospheric disturbances. These topological effects are quantified in terms of integer-valued invariants, such as the Chern number, applicable to the quantum Hall effect, or the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ invariant suitable for topological insulators. Here we engineered Rashba spin-orbit coupling for a cold atomic gas giving non-trivial topology, without the underlying crystalline structure that conventionally yields integer Chern numbers. We validated our procedure by spectroscopically measuring the full dispersion relation, that contained only a single Dirac point. We measured the quantum geometry underlying the dispersion relation and obtained the topological index using matter-wave interferometry. In contrast to crystalline materials, where topological indices take on integer values, our continuum system reveals an unconventional half-integer Chern number, potentially implying new forms of topological transport.},

	abstract = {Following the realization of Bose–Einstein condensates in atomic gases, an experimental challenge is the production of molecular gases in the quantum regime. A promising approach is to create the molecular gas directly from an ultracold atomic gas; for example, bosonic atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate have been coupled to electronic ground-state molecules through photoassociation1 or a magnetic field Feshbach resonance2. The availability of atomic Fermi gases offers the prospect of coupling fermionic atoms to bosonic molecules, thus altering the quantum statistics of the system. Such a coupling would be closely related to the pairing mechanism in a fermionic superfluid, predicted to occur near a Feshbach resonance3,4. Here we report the creation and quantitative characterization of ultracold 40K2 molecules. Starting with a quantum degenerate Fermi gas of atoms at a temperature of less than 150 nK, we scan the system over a Feshbach resonance to create adiabatically more than 250,000 trapped molecules; these can be converted back to atoms by reversing the scan. The small binding energy of the molecules is controlled by detuning the magnetic field away from the Feshbach resonance, and can be varied over a wide range. We directly detect these weakly bound molecules through their radio-frequency photodissociation spectra; these probe the molecular wavefunction, and yield binding energies that are consistent with theory.},

Visualizing edge states in atomic systems Simulating the solid state using ultracold atoms is an appealing research approach. In solids, however, the charged electrons are susceptible to an external magnetic field, which curves their trajectories and makes them skip along the edge of the sample. To observe this phenomenon with cold atoms requires an artificial magnetic field to have a similar effect on the neutral atoms (see the Perspective by Celi and Tarruell). Stuhl et al. obtained skipping orbits with bosonic atoms using a lattice that consisted of an array of atoms in one direction and three internal atomic spin states in the other.

Bringing ultracold atomic gases into the quantum Hall regime is challenging. We engineered an effective magnetic field in a two-dimensional lattice with an elongated-strip geometry, consisting of the sites of an optical lattice in the long direction and of three internal atomic spin states in the short direction. We imaged the localized states of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in this strip; via excitation dynamics, we further observed both the skipping orbits of excited atoms traveling down the system’s edges, analogous to edge magnetoplasmons in two-dimensional electron systems, and a dynamical Hall effect for bulk excitations. Our technique involves minimal heating, which will be important for spectroscopic measurements of the Hofstadter butterfly and realizations of Laughlin’s charge pump.

Chiral edge states are a hallmark of quantum Hall physics. In electronic systems, they appear as a macroscopic consequence of the cyclotron orbits induced by a magnetic field, which are naturally truncated at the physical boundary of the sample. Here we report on the experimental realization of chiral edge states in a ribbon geometry with an ultracold gas of neutral fermions subjected to an artificial gauge field. By imaging individual sites along a synthetic dimension, encoded in the nuclear spin of the atoms, we detect the existence of the edge states and observe the edge-cyclotron orbits induced during quench dynamics. The realization of fermionic chiral edge states opens the door for edge state interferometry and the study of non-Abelian anyons in atomic systems.
Analogs of quantum-Hall-effect edge states are observed with fermionic ytterbium-173 atoms in a synthetic lattice. [Also see Perspective by Celi and Tarruell]

The condensate is clearly distinguished by its large frequency shift. The peak condensate density is 4.8±1.1×1015cm−3, corresponding to a condensate population of 109 atoms. The BEC transition occurs at about T=50μK and n=1.8×1014cm−3.},

	abstract = {Evidence for Bose-Einstein condensation of a gas of spin-polarized 7Li atoms is reported. Atoms confined to a permanent-magnet trap are laser cooled to 200 μK and are then evaporatively cooled to lower temperatures. Phase-space densities consistent with quantum degeneracy are measured for temperatures in the range of 100 to 400 nK. At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate, for total trap numbers as high as 2×105 atoms. For 7Li, the spin-triplet s-wave scattering length is known to be negative, corresponding to an attractive interatomic interaction. Previously, Bose-Einstein condensation was predicted not to occur in such a system.},

	abstract = {SummaryThe superposition of two coherent beams in different states of elliptic polarisation is discussed in a general manner. If A and B represent the states of polarisation of the given beams on the Poincaré sphere, and C that of the resultant beam, the result is simply expressed in terms of the sides,a, b, c of the spherical triangle ABC. The intensity I of the resultant beam is given by:𝐼=𝐼1+𝐼2+2𝐼1𝐼2‾‾‾‾√cos1/2𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛿;I=I1+I2+2I1I2cos1/2ccosδ;I = I\_1 + I\_2 + 2 {\textbackslash}sqrt \{I\_1 I\_2 \} {\textbackslash}cos {\textbackslash}raise.5ex{\textbackslash}hbox\{\${\textbackslash}scriptstyle 1\$\}{\textbackslash}kern-.1em/ {\textbackslash}kern-.15em{\textbackslash}lower.25ex{\textbackslash}hbox\{\${\textbackslash}scriptstyle 2\$\} c cos {\textbackslash}delta ; the extent of mutual interference thus varies from a maximum for identically polarised beams (c = 0), to zero for oppositely polarised beams (c = π). The state of polarisation C of the resultant beam is located by sin2 1/2a = (I1/I) sin2 1/2c and sin2 1/2b = (I2/I) sin2 1/2c. The ‘phase difference’ δ is equal to the supplement of half the area of the triangle C′BA (where C′ is the point diametrically opposite to C). These results also apply to the converse problem of the decomposition of a polarised beam into two others.The interference of two coherent beams after resolution into the same state of elliptic polarisation by an elliptic analyser or compensator is discussed; as also the interference (direct,and after resolution by an analyser) ofn coherent pencils in different states of polarisation.},
