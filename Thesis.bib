	abstract = {Atom-Photon Interactions: Basic Processes and Applications allows the reader to master various aspects of the physics of the interaction between light and matter. It is devoted to the study of the interactions between photons and atoms in atomic and molecular physics, quantum optics, and laser physics. The elementary processes in which photons are emitted, absorbed, scattered, or exchanged between atoms are treated in detail and described using diagrammatic representation. The book presents different theoretical approaches, including:    Perturbative methods  The resolvent method  Use of the master equation  The Langevin equation  The optical Bloch equations  The dressed-atom approach    Each method is presented in a self-contained manner so that it may be studied independently. Many applications of these approaches to simple and important physical phenomena are given to illustrate the potential and limitations of each method.},

	abstract = {The origin of optical forces on atoms has been discussed in Chapter 3, and here a specific application is introduced. The use of electromagnetic forces to influence the motion of neutral atoms has been a subject of interest for some years, and several review articles and books on the subject are listed in Appendix B. The force caused by radiation, particularly by light at or near the resonance frequencies of atomic transitions, originates from the momentum associated with light. In addition to energy E = ℏω, each photon carries momentum ℏk and angular momentum ℏ. When an atom absorbs light, it stores the energy by going into an excited state; it stores the momentum by recoiling from the light source with a momentum ℏk; and it stores the angular momentum in the form of internal motion of its electrons. The converse applies for emission, whether it is stimulated or spontaneous. It is the velocity change of the atoms, vr = ℏk/M ≃ few cm/s, that is of special interest here, and although it is very small compared with thermal velocity, multiple absorptions can be used to produce a large total velocity change. Proper control of this velocity change constitutes a radiative force that can be used to decelerate and/or to cool free atoms.},

First we discuss those methods where the spectral resolution is limited by the Doppler width of the molecular absorption lines. This limit can in fact be reached if the laser linewidth is small compared with the Doppler width. In several examples, such as optical pumping or laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, multimode lasers may be employed, although in most cases single-mode lasers are superior. In general, however, these lasers may not necessarily be frequency stabilized as long as the frequency jitter is small compared with the absorption linewidth. We compare several detection techniques of molecular absorption spectroscopy with regard to their sensitivity and their feasibility in the different spectral regions. Some examples illustrate the methods to give the reader a feeling of what has been achieved. After the discussion of Doppler-limited spectroscopy, Chaps. 2–5 give an extensive treatment of various techniques which allow sub-Doppler spectroscopy.},

These phases are separated by a critical curve containing both first- and second-order transitions joined at a tricritical point. The first-order transition, with observed width as small as h × 4 Hz, gives rise to long-lived metastable states. These measurements are all in agreement with theory.},

Decoherence introduced by the system’s interaction with a quantum environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is made comparable to the correlation time of the environment. The model suggests a strategy to fight against decoherence that complements existing quantum error-correction techniques.},

	abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H0. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},
