\chapter{Basic theory of Bose-Einstein condensation}

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is a quantum state of mater in which particles with integer valued spin all tend to occupy or `condense' into the ground state. In dilute gases, condensation occurs when the temperature of the system goes bellow a critical temperature where the bosons become indistinguishable particles and quantum statistics become relevant. 

BECs enable the observation of macroscopic quantum phenomena and there have been a number of fascinating experiments studying the properties of this systems, from measuring interference fringes from a macroscopic wave function to studying collective effects such as the propagation of sound~\cite{ketterle_w._making_1999}, as well as extensive theoretical developments~\cite{dalfovo_theory_1999}. In our experiments however BECs are not the primary object of study, instead they are used as the platform for performing quantum simulations. 

In this Chapter I describe the basic properties of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases. First I will describe the case of an ideal gas and then consider the effects of interactions and a trapping potential. A reader interested in learning about this subject in more depth is advised to read~\cite{Pethick} and~\cite{noauthor_bose-einstein_2003}.

\subsection{Expansion of atomic cloud in 3D harmonic potential}
How one can infer atomic densities and temperature (from thermal atoms) from time of flight images.


For a given trapping potential $U(\r)$, the density distribution of a thermal ensamble is
\begin{equation}
	n(\r) = n_0 e^{-\frac{U(\r)}{k_BT}}.
\end{equation}
%
The temperature $T$ can be derived from the density distribution. For a 3D harmonic trap
%
\begin{equation}
	n(\r)=n_0e^{-(\frac{x^2}{2\sigma_x^2}+\frac{y^2}{2\sigma_y^2}+\frac{z^2}{2\sigma_z^2})},
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma_i=\omega_i^{-1}\sqrt{k_BT/m}$. Using the equipartition theorem we find that the spatial extension of the cloud and the temperature are related by 
%
\begin{equation}
	T=\frac{m}{k_B}\sigma_i^2\omega_i^2
\end{equation}
%Probably I don't want to talk about any of this stuff...
