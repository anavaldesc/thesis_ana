\chapter{Making BECs in the Rubidium Lithium apparatus}

All the experiments presented in this thesis were performed at the Rubidium-Lithium (RbLi) apparatus at the University of Maryland. The experiment was designed to produce mixtures of quantum degenerate gases of bosons and fermions. The original plan was abandoned because the cross-species scattering length was found to be repulsive and small ($a_s\approx20\,a_B)$~\cite{silber_quantum-degenerate_2005} and the nearest heteronuclear $s$-wave Feshbach resonance was measured to occur at the unexpectedly large magnetic field of $\unit[1066]{G}$~\cite{deh_feshbach_2008} and therefore all our experiments were performed using only $\Rb87$.

The RbLi apparatus is scheduled to be shut down and the construction of a new dual-species apparatus for $\Rb87$ and K$^{39}$ is underway. The RbLi apparatus has been thoroughly described in \cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}. Here I only give a brief overview of the apparatus. Additionally I discuss new elements that have been added to the setup and changes that have been implemented and were not reported in previous thesis.  

\section{Overview of the RbLi apparatus}

In this section I briefly describe the setup of and basic capabilities of the RbLi apparatus. Figure~\ref{fig:RbLi} shows the main optical table where atoms are cooled to degeneracy. The production of BECs starts in an oven where Rb atoms are heated to $\unit[120]{^{\circ}C}$ to produce an atomic beam. The atoms then travel down a Zeeman slower~\cite{phillips_laser_1982} where they are laser cooled. The slowed down atoms are then captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a glass cell, where the remaining cooling and all our experiments are performed. We can detect atoms using two different imaging systems. The first one is used primarily for diagnostics and it images the $yz$ plane of the atoms from the $+\ex$ side of the glass cell. The second system looks at the $xy$ plane from bellow the glass cell and is the main system used for data acquisition. Figure \note{TODO:make simplified diagram of RbLi figure } shows a simplified diagram with a side view and a bird's-eye view of the apparatus with the laser cooling and trapping lasers and the imaging systems.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Laser systems}

We use a total of three lasers to perform laser cooling and imaging of atoms: a cooling laser that addresses the $F=2\rightarrow F'=3$ transition, a repump laser that takes atoms that have decayed into the $F=1$ state back to $F=2$ and a master laser that provides a frequency reference for both lasers. The frequency of master laser is locked using saturation absorption spectroscopy to the $F=3\rightarrow F'=3$ and $F=3\rightarrow F'=4$ crossover of the D2 line of $^{85}$Rb.

We have two additional lasers that are used to generate potentials for the atoms. The first one is a $\unit[30]{W}$ $\unit[1064]{nm}$ \noted{IPG Photonics} laser that we use to make a cross dipole trap for the atoms. The two dipole beams come from the zeroth and first order of an acusto optic modulator (AOM) and the beams propagate along the $\ex+\ey$ and $\ex-\ey$ direction. The other laser system is a Ti:Saphire laser used to generate Raman transitions and will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:Raman_laser}.

\section{Magnetic field control}

The precise control of magnetic fields is essential during the multiple stages in our experimental sequence. We use multiple coils in our experiment as is illustrated in Figure \note{TODO: make magnetic field figure} One pair of anti-Helmholtz coils generates a strong quadrupole magnetic field along $\ez$ that is used in the making of the MOT and for magnetic trapping. Three pairs of Helmholtz coils in the vicinity of the glass cell generate bias magnetic fields along $\ex$, $\ey$ and $\ez$.  Once BECs are produced we typically use bias fields along $\ez$ to change the Zeeman energy of the different $m_F$ states. An additional set of coils arranged in a `clover leaf' pattern generates small gradients along $\ez$, $\ex+\ey$ and $\ez-\ey$ which allow us to cancel stray magnetic gradients at the location of the atoms.  

The experiment also has the capability of producing oscillatory magnetic fields. A set of coils on a printed circuit board (PCB) produce linearly polarized radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields either in the $\ey$ or $\ez$ direction that are used for RF induced evaporation and to drive transitions between $m_F$ states. The setup for producing high-power RF fields will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}.

\label{sec:making-becs}

\subsection{MOT}


-Trigger to the 60Hz line is essential. 


\subsection{Magnetic field stabilization with microwave assisted partial transfer absorption imaging}
\label{sec:ptai}
We then apply a pair of $250\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ microwave  pulses that each transfer a small fraction of atoms into the $5^2{\rm S}_{1/2}$ $f=2$ manifold that we use to monitor and stabilize the bias field \cite{leblanc_direct_2013}. The microwave pulses are detuned by $\pm 2\, \kHz$ from the $\ket{f=1,m_F=0}\leftrightarrow\ket{f=2,m_F=1}$ transition and spaced in time by $33\, \mathrm{ms}$ (two periods of $60\, \mathrm{Hz}$). We imaged the transferred atoms following each pulse using absorption imaging\footnote{We did not apply repump light during this imaging, so the untransferred atoms in the $f=1$ manifold were largely undisturbed by the imaging process.}, and count the total number of atoms $n_1$ and $n_2$ transferred by each pulse. The imbalance in these atom numbers $(n_1-n_2)/(n_1+n_2)$ leads to a $4\kHz$ wide error signal that we use both to monitor the magnetic field before each spectroscopy measurement and cancel longterm drifts in the field. 

\section{Upgrades to the RbLi Machine}

\subsection{Master laser system}
Previously we used a \noted{New Focus Vortex II TLB-6900} extended cavity diode laser as our master laser and a home made saturation spectroscopy setup using a Rb glass cell (see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}). The frequency of this laser was not very stable and the laser would constantly get out of lock. We replaced the old master laser with a \noted{Vescent photonics DBR Laser Moduee System} which uses a distributed Bragg reflector laser diode with no external cavity and is therefore very mechanically stable. The frequency of the laser is stabilized and controlled using the \noted{D2-210} spectroscopy module and \noted{D2-125} laser servo. The master laser system is considerably simplified as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:master_laser}.

\label{fig:master_laser}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Raman laser system}
\label{sec:Raman_laser}

The RbLi apparatus has a laser system with wavelength close to $\unit[790]{nm}$ that is used to generate Raman induced transitions and spin-dependent potentials (see Section~\ref{sec:vector_polarizability}). The original Raman laser system consisted of a \noted{Toptica DL Pro} laser seeding a tapered amplifier mounted on a homemade copper holder. This laser system was replaced by an M squared Ti:Saphire laser (\noted{SolsTiS-400-SRX-F}) that is pumped by a $\unit[532]{nm}$ \noted{IPG GLR30} laser. We typically operate the pump laser at $\unit[14.5]{W}$, a fraction of this light is redirected into the path of a 1D optical lattice and the remaining power is used to pump the Ti:Sahpire laser. We switched to using a Ti:Saph laser because of its wide range of tunable wavelengths in the near infrared ($\unit[725-875]{nm}$) and its high power output. Figure~\ref{fig:tisaph_power} shows the typical dependence of the Ti:Saph output power as a function of pump power. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{Figures/Chapter4/tisaph_power.pdf}
\caption[Ti:Saphire laser output as a function of pump power]{Ti:Saphire laser output as a function of pump power. This data was taken when the laser was being setup for the first time. The alignment of the laser cavity was optimized to produce maximum power at $\unit[15]{W}$ pump power. The output power is proportional to the pump power $P_{\rm{out}}\approx 0.364 P_{\rm{pump}}$. }
\label{fig:tisaph_power}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The output of the laser is split into 3 different Raman beams. The frequency and power of each beam is independently controlled using \noted{IntraAction ATM-801A2} AOMs centered at $\unit[80]{MHz}$. We drive the AOMs using homemade drivers made from the \noted{Minicircuits} components listed in Table~\ref{table:rf_driver} and \noted{Novatech Model 409B} direct digital synthesizer (DDS) to generate an RF signal at the desired frequency. The components are arranged as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RF_driver}: we control the amplitude of the RF signal using a mixer connected to a DC and the switch can turn off the signal in less than $\unit[1]{\mu s}$ using a TTL signal.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{High power RF system}
\label{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}

The experiments described in Chapters~\ref{ch:clock_states} and~\ref{ch:Rashba} required the use of high power RF magnetic fields to achieve coupling strengths at the atoms $\Omega\sim \unit[100-200]{kHz}$. To do so we built a resonant circuit. 
After multiple attempts to build a resonant coil either on a PCB (similar to the coil used for RF induced evaporation, see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}) or winding some wires with the right dimensions we found that the product that worked best for our needs was a wireless power
charging receiver coil (\noted{W\"urth Elektronik} Digikey part number \noted{732-5646-ND}) shown in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}a. The coil has a self resonant frequency at $\unit[22]{MHz}$ and a Q-Factor of 45. It has an inner diameter of $\unit[1.62]{cm}$ and an outer diameter of $\unit[2.8]{cm}$, just the right side for us to place it snugly next to the glass cell (on the $-\ex$ side) with minimal perturbations to the laser beams in its vicinity (it only slightly clips one MOT beam).

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{Figures/Chapter4/high_power_rf.pdf}
\caption[Water cooling manifold schematic]{\note{TODO: write caption for hprf figure}}
\label{fig:high_power_rf}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The loop is mounted on a PCB as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:high_power_rf}. The board has two connections. The top one in Figure~\ref{fig:high_power_rf} has a small loop used as a pickup antenna that we attach to a detector \noted{Minicircuits ZX47-40-S+} to monitor the power of the antenna. The bottom lines have pads that can be used to make an impedance matching network. 

We used a vector network analyzer (VNA) to help us perform the impedance matching. The VNA sends a small amplitude frequency into the circuit and measures the amplitude and phase of the reflected power from which the impedance can be inferred. Figure~\ref{fig:impedance_matching}a shows the reflected power as a function of frequency for a test circuit and Figure~\ref{fig:impedance_matching}b shows the complex valued impedance as a function of frequency displayed on a Smith chart. The Smith chart is a helpful way to visualize the impedance of a circuit: the black circles correspond to constant resistance, with the right most point corresponding to an open circuit (infinite resistance) and the largest circle corresponding to a short circuit (zero resistance).  The arcs correspond to constant reactance; the horizontal axis corresponds to zero reactance ($\mathrm{Im}(Z)=0$), the top arcs correspond to $\mathrm{Im}(Z)>0$ and the lower arcs to $\mathrm{Im}(Z)<0$. The circuit is impedance matched when $Z=\unit[50]{Ohm}$, the standard value of RF transmission lines. We tested different components on the pads until we found a peak in reduced transmission at the desired frequency. For the particular resonant loop that we chose we found that a $\unit[10]{pF}$ capacitor soldered on the third pad and a $0\Omega$ resistor on the first pad was all we needed to get a resonant circuit near our frequency of interest $\sim\unit[23]{MHz}$. It is also important to note that it was important that the circuit was installed in its final location in the experiment when performing this tests as the other parts in the vicinity of the antenna can shift the resonant frequency. %For the particular resonant loop that we chose we found that a $\unit[10]{pF}$ capacitor soldered on the third pad and a $0\Omega$ resistor on the first pad was all we needed to get a resonant circuit near our frequency of interest $\sim\unit[23]{MHz}$.

\label{fig:impedance_matching}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The driving electronics are very similar to the AOM drivers described in Section~\ref{sec:Raman_laser}. The only difference is we use a $\unit[30]{W}$ amplifier (\noted{Minicircuits LZY-22+}) instead of the smaller amplifiers needed to drive the AOMs.

\subsection{$6.8$ GHz microwave system}

Our apparatus now has a $\unit[6.8]{GHz}$ microwave system that allows us to transfer atoms between the $F=1$ and $F=2$ ground hyperfine manifolds of $\Rb87$. We mostly use this system to stabilize the bias magnetic field along $\ez$ at the atoms using microwave assisted partial transfer absorption imaging (PTAI) (see~\ref{sec:ptai}). A list of components used to in the setup is presented in Table~\ref{table:microwave_electronics} and a diagram of the connections is displayed in Figure xxx.

The SRS generator serves as a source of a fixed frequency and amplitude signal. We control the frequency by mixing a programmable $\sim \unit[100]{MHz}$ signal from a \noted{Novatech} into a double balanced mixer; the RF signal can be turned on or off using a TTL switch. The amplitude is controlled by commanding $\unit[0-6]{V}$ signal from the control computer into an attenuator. The signal is amplified by $\unit[+43]{dB}$ using an amplifier mounted on a water cooled plate. The microwave signal is broadcast to the atoms using a horn antenna. The impedance of the transmission line is tuned with the a stub tuner such that reflections are minimized. We additionally use a circulator that prevents any reflected power to go back into the amplifier. We use couplers at different locations to monitor the performance of the system.  

\section{Computer control and data acquisition}

There have been two main changes in our computer control and data acquisition system. We have transitioned from using a \noted{LabVIEW} based control system to a Python based control system \noted{The labscript suite}~\cite{starkey_scripted_2013}. In the previous control software the lab devices were programmed using a graphic interface. \noted{Labscript} instead uses a hybrid approach in which the experimental sequences are based text scripts. The use of scripted programming makes our experiments very modular and additionally it is now very easy to do multi-dimensional parameter scans, both things that were not straightforward to do in the past. Each experimental shot is saved in a Hierarchical Data Format version 5 file (HDF5). The file includes images from cameras, oscilloscope traces and analog inputs as well as copy of the script used in the experiment and the values of the parameters used. This has been a great upgrade as we no longer rely on the person running an experimental sequence pushing the `save' button and fully documenting the experiment in question\footnote{As I have been digging into old data, I greatly wish we had this feature sooner}. 

The other upgrade worth mentioning is replacing our old \noted{Flea3} CCD camera with a \noted{Mako G-030} camera from \noted{Allied Vision}. With this new camera the time between two consecutive shots can be as small as $\unit[96]{\mu s}$ (used to be $\sim\unit[15]{ms}$ with the Flea3 camera), greatly reducing the effect of mechanical vibrations in the experiment that produce fringes in the absorption images. The addition of this camera was essential to get a better signal to noise ratio in the experiments reported in Chapter~\ref{ch:Rashba}. Figure \note{TODO: make before and after Mako figure} shows and absorption image of thermal atoms taken with the old flea 3 and the...
