\chapter{Making BECs in the Rubidium Lithium apparatus}
\label{ch:RbLi}

All the experiments presented in this thesis were performed at the Rubidium-Lithium (RbLi) apparatus at the University of Maryland. The apparatus was designed to produce mixtures of quantum degenerate gases of bosons and fermions. The original plan was abandoned because the cross-species scattering length was found to be repulsive and small ($a_s\approx20\,a_B)$~\cite{silber_quantum-degenerate_2005} and the nearest Feshbach resonance was measured to occur at the unexpectedly large magnetic field of $\unit[1066]{G}$~\cite{deh_feshbach_2008}.  All our experiments were performed using only $\Rb87$ instead.

The RbLi apparatus is scheduled to be shut down and the construction of a new dual-species apparatus for $\Rb87$ and $^{39}$K is underway. The RbLi apparatus has been thoroughly described in \cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis} so I only give a brief overview of the apparatus. I additionally discuss in detail the new elements that have been added to the setup and implemented changes not previously reported. In Appendix~\ref{app:RbLi} I discuss the best and the worst aspects of the apparatus and in Appendix~\ref{app:new_apparatus} I discuss some aspects of the construction of the new apparatus for those interested to look deeper into the technical aspects of experimental apparatus.

This Chapter is divided into three sections. In Section~\ref{sec:RbLi_overview} I give a brief overview of the RbLi apparatus and describe its basic capabilities. In Section~\ref{sec:making-becs} I describe the experimental sequence used to produce BECs. Finally in Section~\ref{sec:RbLi_upgrades} I describe changes and to the RbLi apparatus that were not previously reported.  

\section{Overview of the RbLi apparatus}
\label{sec:RbLi_overview}

% In this section I briefly describe the setup of and basic capabilities of the RbLi apparatus. 
The RbLi apparatus is divided into two optical tables. One table contains laser systems that are fiber-coupled into the main experiment optical table, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RbLi}, containing a vacuum system where atoms are cooled to degeneracy. The vacuum system can be divided into three regions: an oven Region where Rb and Li atoms are heated up, a Zeeman slower that acts as a differential pumping stage and an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) region with a glass cell where all the experiments are performed.

\subsection{Laser systems}

We use a total of three lasers to perform laser cooling and imaging of atoms: a cooling laser that addresses the $F=2\rightarrow F'=3$ transition, a repump laser that takes atoms that have decayed into the $F=1$ state back to $F=2$ via the $F'=1$ state and a master laser that provides a frequency reference for both lasers. The frequency of the master laser is locked using saturation absorption spectroscopy to the $F=3\rightarrow F'=3$ and $F=3\rightarrow F'=4$ crossover of the D2 line of $^{85}$Rb. A fraction of repump and cooling light is used in beam for performing laser-cooling in the Zeeman slower and most of the remaining light is combined in six beams used to create a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We have two additional beams with cooling light used for imaging the atoms along two different directions. The frequencies of each laser with respect to the master laser frequency with respect to the transitions in $\Rb87$ can be visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:laser_frequencies}. 

We have two additional lasers that are used to generate potentials for the atoms. The first one is a $\unit[30]{W}$ $\unit[1064]{nm}$ \noted{IPG Photonics} laser located at the main experiment table and that we use to make a cross dipole trap for the atoms. The two dipole beams come from the zeroth and first order of an acusto-optic modulator (AOM) and the beams propagate along the $\ex+\ey$ and $\ex-\ey$ direction (the lab coordinate system is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RbLi}. The other laser system is a Ti:Sapphire laser used to generate Raman transitions and will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:Raman_laser}. 

 We can detect atoms using two different imaging systems. The first one is used primarily for diagnostics and it images the $yz$ plane of the atoms from the $+\ex$ side of the glass cell. The second system looks at the $xy$ plane from bellow the glass cell and is the main system used for data acquisition. Figure~\ref{fig:RbLi_diagram} shows a simplified diagram with a top and a side view of the apparatus including all the lasers that are used for cooling, trapping, Raman coupling and imaging.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Magnetic field control}

The precise control of magnetic fields is essential during the multiple stages in our experimental sequence. The RbLi apparatus has multiple coils as is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:bias_coils}.   Three pairs of Helmholtz coils in the vicinity of the glass cell generate bias magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}=(B_x, B_y, B_z)$ along $\ex$, $\ey$ and $\ez$.  Once BECs are produced we typically use bias fields along $\ez$ to change the Zeeman energy of the different $\ket{m_F}$ states. One pair of anti-Helmholtz coils generates a strong quadrupole magnetic field along $\ez$ that is used in the MOT, for magnetic trapping, and to separate the different $\ket{m_F}$ states before imaging via the Stern-Gerlach effect. An additional set of coils arranged in a `cloverleaf' pattern generates small gradients along $\ez$, $\ex+\ey$ and $\ez-\ey$ which allow us to cancel stray magnetic gradients in $B_z$ near the atoms.

The experiment also has the capability of producing oscillatory magnetic fields. A set of coils on a printed circuit board (PCB) and placed right above the glass cell produce linearly polarized radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields either in the $\ey$ or $\ez$ direction that are used for RF induced evaporation and to drive transitions between $\ket{m_F}$ states. There is an additional setup for producing high-power RF fields which will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}.

\section{Experimental sequence to make BECs}
\label{sec:making-becs}

%n this section I list the steps in our experimental sequence that produces $\Rb87$ BECs.

The production of BECs starts in an oven where Rb atoms are heated to $\unit[120]{C}$ to produce an atomic beam. The Rb atoms come from the same $\unit[5]{g}$ ampule that was installed when the apparatus was first built almost 10 years ago. The atoms then travel down a Zeeman slower~\cite{phillips_laser_1982} where they are laser cooled and then captured in a MOT. For the MOT we apply a $\unit[5.5]{A}$ current to the quadrupole coils corresponding to a $\unit[15.62]{G/cm}$ gradient. The cooling light is blue detuned by $\unit[18]{MHz}\sim-3\Gamma$ from the $F=2\rightarrow F'=3$ cycling transition and the repump light is $\unit[16]{MHz}$ below the $F=1\rightarrow F'=2$ transition. We typically load the MOT for a total time of $\unit[1-5]{s}$ before we turn off the Zeeman slower currents. In preparation for the molasses stage we do a $\unit[30]{ms}$ decompression stage where we ramp down the gradient to $\unit[10]{G/cm}$ and reduce the repump power. 

The atoms are cooled further down in an optical molasses stage due to the polarization gradient from interfering counter-propagating lasers~\cite{lett_observation_1988}. For this stage we completely switch off the quadrupole coils and adjust the bias fields in all three directions so that they are canceled at the atoms. During this stage, the repump power is kept low and the frequency of the cooling light is decreased to $\unit[140]{MHz}$ below the MOT frequency for $\unit[10]{ms}$. We then completely turn off the MOT repump light allowing atoms to decay into the $F=1$ manifold and use a small amount of repump light from the Zeeman slower to optically pump atoms into the $\ket{F=1,m_F=-1}$ magnetically trappable state for a total of $\unit[1.5]{ms}$.

Once the atoms are successfully pumped into $\ket{F=1, m_F=-1}$ we capture them in a magnetic trap with a gradient of $\unit[62]{G/cm}$ and compress them by increasing the current in the coils until we reach a gradient of $\unit[160]{G/cm}$ in $\unit[300]{ms}$ to enhance
the elastic collisional rates and promote faster thermalization during evaporation. We perform RF-induced evaporation in the magnetic trap by turning on an RF field polarized along $\ey$ with a frequency of $\unit[24]{MHz}$, which transfers the hotter atoms at the edges of the trap into the $m_F=0$ state which is not magnetically trappable. We then perform an exponential ramp from the initial frequency to a final frequency of $\unit[4.5]{MHz}$ in $\unit[1]{s}$, and as the frequency is swept the most energetic atoms are selectively transfered into untrappable states.  

For the final stage of evaporative cooling, we transfer the atoms from the magnetic trap into an optical dipole trap. We start by turning on only the `tight' arm of the trap at full power (about $\unit[11]{W}$) and slowly decompressing the quadrupole trap to $\unit[45]{G/cm}$ in $\unit[1.5]{s}$. We then turn on the second `cross' beam in $\unit[1]{s}$, splitting the power so that $70-30\%$ is distributed between the tight and cross beams. As the cross dipole beam is being turned on, we ramp the quadrupole field further down to $\unit[14]{G/cm}$, slightly above the value necessary for the trap to suspend atoms against gravity while simultaneously shifting the bias field along $\ez$ to align the center of the quadrupole trap to the dipole trap. 

We evaporate atoms in the dipole trap in two stages. First we exponentially ramp down the power to about $20\%$ of its initial power in $\unit[1.5]{s}$ ($\unit[0.5]{s}$ $1/e$ time). Before the final evaporation stage we completely turn off the quadrupole trap in $\unit[1]{s}$. Finally, we perform a second exponential ramp where the power is dropped to about $30\%$ of the intermediate power in $\unit[2]{s}$ ($\unit[1]{s}$ $1/e$ time). The slow ramps ensure that there is enough time for the atoms to thermalize as they evaporate.   During the second evaporation stage the atoms reach the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation and we are able to produce BECs with about $4\times10^4$ atoms in the $\ket{F=1, m_F=-1}$ state. To transfer atoms into different $\ket{F, m_F}$ states within the ground $5^2S_{1/2}$ manifold we use the ARP protocol described in Section~\ref{sec:arp}.

Our experiments are very sensitive to changes in the environmental magnetic field. In the past we used flux gate sensors (\noted{Stefan-Mayer} model \noted{FL1-100 f}) in the apparatus to feedback and stabilize the magnetic field (see~\cite{PriceThesis}). This sensors are a useful tool, however due to space constraints we were not able to measure the fields close to the atoms and additionally the range of magnetic fields that they operate at is small (only $\unit[1]{G}$, we typically operate at $B>\unit[10]{G}$). We built a $\unit[6.8]{GHz}$ microwave system (see Section~\ref{sec:microwave_system}) so that we could use the atoms themselves as sensors of magnetic field. Once BEC is achieved and before performing any experiment, we typically use a protocol involving two microwave assisted partial transfer absorption images described in Section~\ref{sec:ptai} to monitor and stabilize the magnetic field at the atoms.  

To keep the bias magnetic fields as stable as possible we additionally synchronize the timing of our experiments to the $\unit[60]{Hz}$ line; this step is performed in different stages of the experiment but its biggest impact is right before performing any magnetically sensitive experiment.

\section{Upgrades to the RbLi Machine}
\label{sec:RbLi_upgrades}

\subsection{Master laser system}
Previously we used a \noted{New Focus Vortex II TLB-6900} extended cavity diode laser as our master laser locked using a homemade saturation spectroscopy setup using a Rb glass cell and an FPGA based PID circuit (see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}). The frequency of this laser was not very stable and the laser would constantly get out of lock. We replaced the old master laser with a \noted{Vescent photonics DBR Laser Module System} which uses a distributed Bragg reflector laser diode with no external cavity and is therefore very mechanically stable. The frequency of the laser is stabilized and controlled using the \noted{D2-210} spectroscopy module and \noted{D2-125} laser servo. The master laser system is considerably simplified as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:master_laser} and the lab no longer suffers from an unstable master laser.

\caption[Master laser system]{Master laser system. We replaced the old Vortex II laser with a Vescent photonics DBR Laser Module System that is considerably more stable.}
\label{fig:master_laser}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Raman laser system}
\label{sec:Raman_laser}

The RbLi apparatus has a laser system with wavelength close to $\unit[790]{nm}$ that is used to generate Raman induced transitions and spin-dependent potentials (see Section~\ref{sec:vector_polarizability}). The original Raman laser system consisted of a \noted{Toptica DL Pro} laser seeding a tapered amplifier chip mounted on a homemade copper holder. This laser system was replaced by an M squared Ti:Sapphire laser (\noted{SolsTiS-400-SRX-F}) that is pumped by a $\unit[532]{nm}$ \noted{IPG GLR30} laser. We typically operate the pump laser at $\unit[14.5]{W}$. A fraction of this light is redirected into the path of a 1D optical lattice and the remaining power is used to pump the Ti:Sahpire laser. Figure~\ref{fig:tisaph_power} shows the typical dependence of the Ti:Sapph output power as a function of pump power. We switched to using a Ti:Sapph laser because of its wide range of tunable wavelengths in the near infrared ($\unit[725-875]{nm}$) and its high power output. In addition to this, the TA system had considerable amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) close to $\unit[780]{nm}$ which caused increased scattering of photons and reduced lifetimes due to our inability to completely filter it.  

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{Figures/Chapter4/tisaph_power.pdf}
\caption[Ti:Sapphire laser output as a function of pump power]{Ti:Sapphire laser output as a function of pump power. This data was taken when the laser was being setup for the first time. The alignment of the laser cavity was optimized to produce maximum power at $\unit[15]{W}$ pump power. The output power is proportional to the pump power $P_{\rm{out}}\approx 0.364 P_{\rm{pump}}$. }
\label{fig:tisaph_power}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The output of the laser is split into 3 different Raman beams. The frequency and power of each beam is independently controlled using \noted{IntraAction ATM-801A2} AOMs centered at $\unit[80]{MHz}$. We drive the AOMs using homemade drivers made from the \noted{Minicircuits} components listed in Table~\ref{table:rf_driver} and \noted{Novatech Model 409B} direct digital synthesizer (DDS) to generate an RF signal at the desired frequency. The components are arranged as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RF_driver}: we control the amplitude of the RF signal using a mixer connected to a DC signal and the switch can turn off the signal in less than $\unit[1]{\mu s}$ using a TTL signal. We fiber-couple the light using single-mode optical fibers (non-polarization maintaining) with angle-cut FC/APC type connectors at the input  (laser side) and flat-cut FC/PC at the output (experiment side). We made this choice so to implement a phase lock that would cancel phase noise added by the fibers. The idea behind this method is that a small fraction of the fiber-coupled light is reflected at the flat-cut edge of the optical fiber and coupled back where it can be heterodyne probed with the input light (see Figure~\ref{fig:Raman_setup}). Our implementation of the fiber phase lock is based on Section 3.6.3 of~\cite{BeckerThesis}. Because the fibers are not polarization maintaining  we control the output polarization of the light using paddles (\noted{Thorlabs FPC030} and \noted{Thorlabs FPC560}) that produce a controllable amount of stress in the fibers and therefore changes their birefringence. This method makes injecting light into the fiber very straightforward and painless because, unlike with polarization-maintaining fibers, the polarization of the incoming light can be arbitrary and does not need to be aligned to any fiber axis. None of the experiments presented in this thesis used the phase lock but the experiments described in Chapter~\ref{ch:Rashba} were performed using the new Raman laser system. Figure~\ref{fig:Raman_setup} shows a diagram of the Raman optics as well as the $\unit[532]{nm}$ optical lattice optics which are shared on the same breadboard.

\subsection{High power RF system}
\label{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}

The experiments described in Chapters~\ref{ch:clock_states} and~\ref{ch:Rashba} required the use of high power RF magnetic fields to achieve coupling strengths at the atoms $\Omega\sim \unit[100-200]{kHz}$. %To do so we built a resonant circuit with a coil close to the atoms. 
After multiple attempts to build a resonant coil either on a PCB (similar to the coil used for RF induced evaporation, see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}) or winding some wires with the right dimensions we found that the product that worked best for our needs was a wireless power
charging receiver coil (\noted{W\"urth Elektronik} Digikey part number \noted{732-5646-ND}) shown in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}a. The coil has a self-resonant frequency at $\unit[22]{MHz}$ and a Q-Factor of 45. It has an inner diameter of $\unit[1.62]{cm}$ and an outer diameter of $\unit[2.8]{cm}$, just the right size for us to place it snugly next to the glass cell (on the $-\ex$ side) with minimal perturbations to the laser beams in its vicinity (it only slightly clips one MOT beam).

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{Figures/Chapter4/high_power_rf.pdf}
\caption[High power RF system]{We use a commercial resonator with an impedance matching network to produce high power RF fields. {\bf a.} Diagram of the impedance matching network. {\bf b.} A picture of the resonator mounted on a PCB. We place this device as close to the atoms as possible next to the glass cell.}
\label{fig:high_power_rf}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The loop is mounted on the PCB shown in Figure~\ref{fig:high_power_rf}. The board has two connections: the top one in Figure~\ref{fig:high_power_rf} has a small loop used as a pickup antenna that we attach to a power detector \noted{Minicircuits ZX47-40-S+} to monitor the power and the bottom lines have pads that can be used to make an impedance matching network.  

We used a vector network analyzer (VNA) to help us perform the impedance matching. The VNA sends a small amplitude frequency into the circuit and measures the amplitude and phase of the reflected power from which the impedance can be inferred. Figure~\ref{fig:impedance_matching}a shows the reflected power as a function of frequency for a test circuit and Figure~\ref{fig:impedance_matching}b shows the complex valued impedance as a function of frequency displayed on a Smith chart. The Smith chart is a helpful way to visualize the impedance of a circuit: the black circles correspond to constant resistance, with the rightmost point corresponding to an open circuit (infinite resistance) and the largest circle corresponding to a short circuit (zero resistance).  The arcs correspond to constant reactance; the horizontal axis corresponds to zero reactance ($\mathrm{Im}(Z)=0$), the top arcs correspond to $\mathrm{Im}(Z)>0$, and the lower arcs to $\mathrm{Im}(Z)<0$. The circuit is impedance matched when $Z=\unit[50]{Ohm}$ (the center of the Smith chart), the standard value of RF transmission lines. We tested different components on the pads until we found a peak in reduced reflected power at the desired frequency. It is also important to note that it was essential that the circuit was installed in its final location in the experiment when measuring the impedance as the other parts in the vicinity of the antenna can shift the resonant frequency. %For the particular resonant loop that we chose we found that a $\unit[10]{pF}$ capacitor soldered on the third pad and a $0\Omega$ resistor on the first pad was all we needed to get a resonant circuit near our frequency of interest $\sim\unit[23]{MHz}$.

\label{fig:impedance_matching}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The driving electronics are very similar to the AOM drivers described in Section~\ref{sec:Raman_laser}. The only difference is we use a $\unit[30]{W}$ amplifier (\noted{Minicircuits LZY-22+}) instead of the smaller amplifiers needed to drive the AOMs.

\subsection{$6.8$ GHz microwave system}
\label{sec:microwave_system}

We built a $\unit[6.8]{GHz}$ microwave system to couple atoms between the $F=1$ and $F=2$ ground hyperfine manifolds of $\Rb87$. We mostly use this system to stabilize the bias magnetic field along $\ez$ at the atoms using microwave assisted PTAI (Section~\ref{sec:ptai}). A list of components used in the setup is presented in Table~\ref{table:microwave_electronics} and a diagram of the connections is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:uwaves}.

\end{table}
%
The SRS generator serves as a source of a fixed frequency and amplitude signal. We control the frequency by mixing a programmable $\sim \unit[100]{MHz}$ signal from a \noted{Novatech} into a double balanced mixer; the RF signal can be turned on or off using a TTL switch. The amplitude is controlled by commanding $\unit[0-6]{V}$ signal from the control computer into an attenuator. The signal is amplified by $\unit[+43]{dB}$ using an amplifier mounted on a water cooled plate. The microwave signal is broadcast to the atoms using a horn antenna. In order to get a coupling microwave coupling strenght of the order of $\unit[10]{kHz}$ or larger it was important to place the horn as close to the atoms as possible and impedance matching the transmission line to maximize the radiated power. We additionally use a circulator that prevents any reflected power to go back into the amplifier and couplers at different locations to monitor the performance of the system. The last coupler and the circulator of the system are connected to a power detector that outputs a DC signal proportional to the microwave power. The impedance is tuned with a stub tuner by changing the length of the stubs until the reflected power measured at the exit port of the circulator is minimized at the desired frequency of operation.

\section{Computer control and data acquisition}

There have been two main changes in our computer control and data acquisition system. We have transitioned from using a \noted{LabVIEW} based control system to a Python based control system, \noted{The labscript suite}~\cite{starkey_scripted_2013}. With the previous control software the lab devices were programmed using a graphic interface. \noted{Labscript} instead uses a hybrid approach in which the experimental sequences are text based scripts. The use of scripted programming has given us more flexibility and modularity for programming experiments and additionally, it is now very easy to do multi-dimensional parameter scans. Each experimental shot is saved in a Hierarchical Data Format version 5 file (HDF5) that includes images from cameras, oscilloscope traces, and analog inputs as well as copy of the script used in the experiment and the values of all of the parameters used. This has been a great upgrade as we no longer rely on the person running an experimental sequence pushing the `save' button and thoroughly documenting the experiment in question\footnote{As I have been digging into old data, I greatly wish we had this feature sooner.}. 

The other upgrade worth mentioning is replacing our old \noted{Flea3} (\noted{FL3-FW-03S1M-C} from \noted{FLIR}, formerly \noted{Point Grey}) CCD camera with a \noted{Mako G-030} camera from \noted{Allied Vision}. With this new camera the time between two consecutive shots can be as short as $\unit[96]{\mu s}$ (we used to wait $\sim\unit[30]{ms}$ with the Flea3 camera), greatly reducing the effect of mechanical vibrations in the experiment that produce fringes in the absorption images. Table~\ref{table:cameras} summarizes relevant specifications of both cameras.  In our experimental sequence the probe and atoms images are separated by $\unit[150]{\mu s}$, which is not enough time for the atoms in the first absorption image to be cleared out. We therefore had to change the order in the absorption imaging protocol: first we take a picture of the probe which is $\unit[6.8]{GHz}$ detuned and minimally disturbs the atoms, we then apply repump light during the $\unit[150]{\mu s}$ interval in between the images to transfer atoms into $F=2$ and then take the absorption image of the atoms. Figure\ref{fig:probe_comparison} shows the OD computed using both cameras with no atoms present. When there is a long interval in between the two images the probe captured on the camera changes, leading to the fringes shown in Figure\ref{fig:probe_comparison}a. In contrast for probe images captured within a short interval the main noise contribution is shot noise as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:probe_comparison}b. The addition of this camera was essential to get a better signal to noise ratio in the experiments reported in Chapter~\ref{ch:Rashba}.

% We then apply a pair of $250\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ microwave  pulses that each transfer a small fraction of atoms into the $5^2{\rm S}_{1/2}$ $f=2$ manifold that we use to monitor and stabilize the bias field \cite{leblanc_direct_2013}. The microwave pulses are detuned by $\pm 2\, \kHz$ from the $\ket{f=1,m_F=0}\leftrightarrow\ket{f=2,m_F=1}$ transition and spaced in time by $33\, \mathrm{ms}$ (two periods of $60\, \mathrm{Hz}$). We imaged the transferred atoms following each pulse using absorption imaging\footnote{We did not apply repump light during this imaging, so the untransferred atoms in the $f=1$ manifold were largely undisturbed by the imaging process.}, and count the total number of atoms $n_1$ and $n_2$ transferred by each pulse. The imbalance in these atom numbers $(n_1-n_2)/(n_1+n_2)$ leads to a $4\kHz$ wide error signal that we use both to monitor the magnetic field before each spectroscopy measurement and cancel longterm drifts in the field.
