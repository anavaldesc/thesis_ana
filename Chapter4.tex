\chapter{Making BECs in the Rubidium Lithium apparatus}

All the experiments presented in this thesis were performed at the Rubidium-Lithium (RbLi) apparatus at the University of Maryland. The experiment was designed to produce mixtures of quantum degenerate gases of bosons and fermions. The original plan was abandoned because the cross-species scattering length was found to be repulsive and small ($a_s\approx20\,a_B)$~\cite{silber_quantum-degenerate_2005} and the nearest heteronuclear $s$-wave Feshbach resonance was measured to occur at the unexpectedly large magnetic field of $\unit[1066]{G}$~\cite{deh_feshbach_2008} and therefore all our experiments were performed using only $\Rb87$.

The RbLi apparatus is scheduled to be shut down and the construction of a new dual-species apparatus for $\Rb87$ and K$^{39}$ is underway. The RbLi apparatus has been thoroughly described in \cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}. Here I only give a brief overview of the apparatus. Additionally I discuss new elements that have been added to the setup and changes that have been implemented and were not reported in previous thesis.  

\section{Basics of the RbLi apparatus}

In this section I briefly describe the setup of and basic capabilities of the RbLi apparatus. Figure~\ref{fig:RbLi} shows the main optical table where atoms are cooled to degeneracy. The production of BECs starts in an oven where Rb atoms are heated to $\unit[120]{^{\circ}C}$ to produce an atomic beam. The atoms then travel down a Zeeman slower~\cite{phillips_laser_1982} where they are laser cooled. The slowed down atoms are then captured in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a glass cell, where the remaining cooling and all our experiments are performed.

\subsection{Laser systems}

We use a total of three lasers to perform laser cooling and imaging of atoms: a cooling laser that addresses the $F=2\rightarrow F'=3$ transition, a repump laser that takes atoms that have decayed into the $F=1$ state back to $F=2$ and a master laser that provides a frequency reference for both lasers. The frequency of master laser is locked using saturation absorption spectroscopy to the $F=3\rightarrow F'=3$ and $F=3\rightarrow F'=4$ crossover of the D2 line of $^{85}$Rb.

We can detect atoms using two different imaging systems. The first one is used primarily for diagnostics and it images the $yz$ plane of the atoms from the $+\ex$ side of the glass cell. The second system looks at the $xy$ plane from bellow the glass cell and is the main system used for data acquisition. 

\note{TODO:make basic sketch of lasers, small changes to mot and imaging path should be reflected}

\section{Magnetic field control}

The precise control of magnetic fields is essential during the multiple stages in our experimental sequence. We use multiple coils in our experiment as is illustrated in Figure \note{TODO: make magnetic field figure} One pair of anti-Helmholtz coils generates a strong quadrupole magnetic field along $\ez$ that is used in the making of the MOT and for magnetic trapping. Three pairs of Helmholtz coils in the vicinity of the glass cell generate bias magnetic fields along $\ex$, $\ey$ and $\ez$.  Once BECs are produced we typically use bias fields along $\ez$ to change the Zeeman energy of the different $m_F$ states. An additional set of coils arranged in a `clover leaf' pattern generates small gradients along $\ez$, $\ex+\ey$ and $\ez-\ey$ which allow us to cancel stray magnetic gradients at the location of the atoms.  

The experiment also has the capability of producing oscillatory magnetic fields. A set of coils on a printed circuit board (PCB) produce linearly polarized radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields either in the $\ey$ or $\ez$ direction that are used for RF induced evaporation and to drive transitions between $m_F$ states. The setup for producing high-power RF fields will be described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}.

\section{New master laser}
Previously we used a \noted{New Focus Vortex II TLB-6900} extended cavity diode laser as our master laser and a home made saturation spectroscopy setup using a Rb glass cell (see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}). The frequency of this laser was not very stable and the laser would constantly get out of lock. We replaced the old master laser with a \noted{Vescent photonics DBR Laser Moduee System} which uses a distributed Bragg reflector laser diode with no external cavity and is therefore very mechanically stable. The frequency of the laser is stabilized and controlled using the \noted{D2-210} spectroscopy module and \noted{D2-125} laser servo. The master laser system is considerably simplified as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:master_laser}.

\section{New Raman laser system}
\label{sec:Raman_laser}

The RbLi apparatus has a laser system with wavelength close to $\unit[790]{nm}$ that is used to generate Raman induced transitions and spin-dependent potentials (see Section~\ref{sec:vector_polarizability}). The original Raman laser system consisted of a \noted{Toptica DL Pro} laser seeding a tapered amplifier mounted on a homemade copper holder. This laser system was replaced by an M squared Ti:Saphire laser (\noted{SolsTiS-400-SRX-F}) that is pumped by a $\unit[532]{nm}$ \noted{IPG GLR30} laser. We typically operate the pump laser at $\unit[14.5]{W}$, a fraction of this light is redirected into the path of a 1D optical lattice and the remaining power is used to pump the Ti:Sahpire laser. We switched to using a Ti:Saph laser because of its wide range of tunable wavelengths in the near infrared ($\unit[725-875]{nm}$) and its high power output. Figure~\ref{fig:tisaph_power} shows the typical dependence of the Ti:Saph output power as a function of pump power. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]

\caption[Ti:Saphire laser output as a function of pump power]{Ti:Saphire laser output as a function of pump power. This data was taken when the laser was being setup for the first time. The alignment of the laser cavity was optimized to produce maximum power at $\unit[15]{W}$ pump power.}
\label{fig:tisaph_power}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The output of the laser is split into 3 different Raman beams. The frequency and power of each beam is independently controlled using \noted{IntraAction ATM-801A2} acousto-optic modulators(AOMs) centered at $\unit[80]{MHz}$. We drive the AOMs using homemade drivers made from the \noted{Minicircuits} components listed in Table~\ref{table:rf_driver} and \noted{Novatech Model 409B} direct digital synthesizer (DDS) to generate an RF signal at the desired frequency. The components are arranged as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RF_driver}: we control the amplitude of the RF signal using a mixer connected to a DC and the switch can turn off the signal in less than $\unit[1]{\mu s}$ using a TTL signal.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{High power RF electronics}
\label{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}

The experiments described in Chapters~\ref{ch:clock_states} and~\ref{ch:Rashba} required the use of high power RF magnetic fields to achieve coupling strengths at the atoms $\Omega\sim \unit[100-200]{kHz}$. To do so we built a resonant circuit. 
After multiple attempts to build a resonant coil either on a PCB (similar to the coil used for RF induced evaporation, see~\cite{CampbellThesis,PriceThesis}) or winding some wires with the right dimensions we found that the product that worked best for our needs was a wireless power
charging receiver coil (\noted{W\"urth Elektronik} Digikey part number \noted{732-5646-ND}) shown in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{sec:high_power_rf_antenna}a. The coil has a self resonant frequency at $\unit[22]{MHz}$ and a Q-Factor of 45. It has an inner diameter of $\unit[1.62]{cm}$ and an outer diameter of $\unit[2.8]{cm}$, just the right side for us to place it snugly next to the glass cell (on the $-\ex$ side) with minimal perturbations to the laser beams in its vicinity (it only slightly clips one MOT beam).

The loop is mounted on a PCB as is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:high_power_rf}. The board has two

\subsection{$6.8$ GHz microwave electronics}

\section{Computer control and data acquisition}
Our lab has transitioned from using a \noted{LabVIEW} based control system to a Python based control system \noted{the labscriopt suite}. The new control software allows us to use scripted programming 

\noted{labscript} has 


his allowed us to use scripted programming on our devices
[161]. With labscript, a fuller exploration of the parameter spaces was feasible
and close-loop optimization of experimental parameters could be done online while
running the experiment.

\subsection{Magnetic field stabilization with microwaves and partial transfer absorption imaging}
\label{sec:ptai}
We then apply a pair of $250\,\mu\mathrm{s}$ microwave  pulses that each transfer a small fraction of atoms into the $5^2{\rm S}_{1/2}$ $f=2$ manifold that we use to monitor and stabilize the bias field \cite{leblanc_direct_2013}. The microwave pulses are detuned by $\pm 2\, \kHz$ from the $\ket{f=1,m_F=0}\leftrightarrow\ket{f=2,m_F=1}$ transition and spaced in time by $33\, \mathrm{ms}$ (two periods of $60\, \mathrm{Hz}$). We imaged the transferred atoms following each pulse using absorption imaging\footnote{We did not apply repump light during this imaging, so the untransferred atoms in the $f=1$ manifold were largely undisturbed by the imaging process.}, and count the total number of atoms $n_1$ and $n_2$ transferred by each pulse. The imbalance in these atom numbers $(n_1-n_2)/(n_1+n_2)$ leads to a $4\kHz$ wide error signal that we use both to monitor the magnetic field before each spectroscopy measurement and cancel longterm drifts in the field.
