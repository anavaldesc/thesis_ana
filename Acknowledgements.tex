I was very lucky to be surrounded by an amazing group of people throughout my PhD. None of this would have been possible without them and I feel infinitely lucky and grateful for that. 

I would like to start by thanking my advisor Dr. Ian Spielman. 

I was exposed to a cold atoms lab for the first time when I spent a summer working in a lab of Dr. Luis Orozco. I thank him for giving me this opportunity that would later define the course of my PhD. He is a great mentor who cares very deeply about his students. I am extremely grateful for his support throughout my years at UMD, for all the delicious meals and bread, the concerts and the good stories. 

I would like to thank Dr. Bill Phillips for always being  warm and welcoming and for taking the time to participate in `paper torture' sessions with me. I learned a lot of physics (and history of physics) from this interactions. I would also like to thank him for being an endless source of chocolate. 

My research was performed at the RbLi lab at UMD, where I was lucky  that my path crossed with a lot of wonderful physicists and also now good friends. First I would like to thank  Daniel Campbell, Ryan Price and Andika Putra for welcoming me to RbLi and patiently teaching me about the lab. A very special thank you goes to our former postdoc Dimitri Trypogeorgos for taking me under his wing and becoming my lab brother. He is a brilliant scientist who really helped to shape my PhD. I am extremely grateful for all his physics and life teachings as well as his friendship. I would also like to thank and acknowledge my current lab mates. Qi-Yu Liang for her brutal honesty and for the physics discussions that tended to start with confusion and end with enlightenment. I also thank her for the rabbit pictures and videos and for our food discussions. I admire her determination and her ability to stand up for what she believes in. Mingshu Zhao and Junheng Tao for their enthusiasm and diligently taking over the tasks of building a new apparatus. I am also grateful for their encouraging words when I was writing this thesis and my last paper. They are very smart physicists and I am sure there will be great things to come in the new lab. 

Our lab was also very fortunate to have a couple brilliant visitors. I thank Nathan Lundblad for all his help when the lab was feeling a bit understaffed. I would also like to thank Russ `Mr. Broadband' Andersson for all the helpful experimental diagnostics gadgets, the very thorough help on calculations and comments on papers, and for always being in such a good mood. It was great fun to have him around. 

I have been away from the lab many months now and instead spending a great deal of time in my office. I would like to thank my office mates for making it all more fun. Hector Soza Mart\'inez for being absolutely ridiculous. His sense of humor reminds me that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. Joao `the champ' Braz for being a great theory buddy. I really enjoyed our physics discussions and am thankful for all the thorough comments on the Rashba paper. I am also thankful that he made me leave my desk to get a beer when he thought I needed a break. Dina Genkina for always listening and offering encouraging words, also for the constant flow of Kit Kats.
