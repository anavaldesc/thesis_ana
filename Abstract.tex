This work presents the realization of single and multi component 1D Bose gases by using a tightly focused, blue-detuned, LG$_{01}$ dipole trap. After carefully engineering and calibrating an additional axial trapping potential $ V(x) $, we employ the local density approximation to extract the equation of state (EoS)  $n(\mu, T)$ using \textit{in-situ} absorption imaging. With this, different interaction regimes that are characterized by the inhomogeneous Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma(x) = c \,/n(x)$, are identified. We then show that the density-density correlations contained in the $g^{(2)}(x_{1}, x_{2})$ correlator are recovered from the same data. While the EoS displays the local thermodynamic properties of the system, the second-order correlation function can directly reveal the presence of anticorrelated (fermionized) bosons in our system and allow us to calibrate our system with unprecedented accuracy.
